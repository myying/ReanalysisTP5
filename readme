# techenical issues for prepareing the script to test assimilation run
#
# 1) Checking principal directories:
#    ERROR: no ROOTDIR="/cluster/work/users/xiejp/TP2_REANALYSIS" found

# 2) assimilate.sh: ERROR: FORECASTDIR = "/cluster/work/users/xiejp/TP2_Reanalysis/FORECAST": no such directory
#    link the data directory to the FORECAST directory
#  And another manually linking the postprepared observation directory:
#    ln -sf ${targetdirctirt} OBS
#

# 3) ERROR: check_files.sh: "depths800x880.uf" not found
#   ensure the files listed in check_file.sh should be right, matched with the model domain
#

#  4) modify ./SCRIPTS/assimilate.sh: line 196: ./SCRIPTS/link_inputs.sh
#   because the restart file should be matched well with the used model system
#
